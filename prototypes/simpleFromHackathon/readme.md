# Simple template

This is the template that was developed at the Hackathon in Seoul, the DCMI 2019 meeting. 
This greatly reduced the template to key elements that could be included on a single 
spreadsheet row.

1.  Template_for_documentation.csv
1.  Template_for_instance_data.csv

A simple template similar to the profile2 template. The valueType is general (e.g. entity, literal, uri). It has a position for an entity value.

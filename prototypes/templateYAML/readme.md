# Example in YAML

1. bookCaseEG.xls
1. bookCaseEG.ods
1. bookCaseEG.yaml

This does not (yet) have a profile template file; however, a template for this model . The YAML file makes use of entities and values that have identifiers and are each "called" from the higher entity level (e.g. description entity "calls" statement entities). The spreadsheet file (.xls or .ods) uses a separate sheet for each identified entity.
